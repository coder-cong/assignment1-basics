Some pronunciation work with IELTS students can really help them understand what they hear, help their general English listening skills more than concentrating on exam tactics would, and also give them techniques and things to work on which will help with their speaking in the longer term. This article explains the most useful and motivating ways to deal with pronunciation in preparation for IELTS Listening, and for improved English more generally. For over 350 pages of photocopiable materials for IELTS Listening and over 1000 pages on IELTS more generally, see https://www.usingenglish.com/e-books/

Pronunciation points which are likely to help students understand IELTS Listening and get the right answers in it include:

differences between spelling and pronunciation (silent letters, double letters, etc)
sentence stress (especially noticing which words are stressed and so are the content words which are likely to be important to answer the questions)
connected speech (intrusive sounds, elision, etc)
homophones (that they need to write “fare” not “fair”, etc)
minimal pairs (that they need to write “van” not “ban”, etc)
unstressed vowel sounds/ schwa (in words, as weak forms, etc)
intonation (especially changes in intonation to show changes in topic, intonation showing the speaker’s attitude such as if they agree or not, and perhaps intonation to show punctuation such as quotation marks)
spelling and pronunciation rules (Magic E, etc)
pronouncing the alphabet (for words which are spelt in IELTS Listening Part 1)
pronouncing numbers (mostly also for Part 1)
pronunciation in accents they are less used to (often British or Australian pronunciation)
consonant clusters
The activities below can all be used to cover one or more these points.

 

Listen again and repeat
If you notice that students have got the wrong answer in IELTS Listening because they couldn’t catch what was said, the simplest and most useful pronunciation practice is simply for them to listen again and repeat what they hear. As with all the pronunciation practice in this article, it is worth telling students that this is mainly to help them recognise what they hear next time, not a sign that they need to pronounce it exactly that way themselves. To help them repeat what they hear in the recording, you could:

write up the words which are used
mark stresses with small and large circles above the words (e.g. “oooOo” above “accommodation”)
mark difficult sounds with the phonemic script and/ or more familiar words which have the same sounds
put brackets around sounds which are silent or nearly silent (“wan(t) to go”, etc)
show linking between words with a line showing where the sound links to or showing the sound where it is pronounced instead of how it is spelt (“a napple”, etc)
add intrusive sounds (“We yare”, etc)
pronounce it is a slower and/ or more exaggerated way
use gestures to show stress, pauses, intonation, etc
give feedback on their efforts to copy how it is said (perhaps most useful as “That is also fine, but this speaker says…”)
play the recording until they can copy what it says over the recording, with the same timing and rhythm
The same techniques can also be used if students look at the transcript after listening and have questions about how things were pronounced.

 

Transcribe then repeat
The problem with the tips above is that it is often difficult to know why students got answers wrong, and they are much more likely to ask about meaning than about pronunciation. Rather than going straight to the transcript and answer key, it is sometimes worth checking their answers by playing the recording again and stopping after each answer is given (plus sometimes stopping after distractors such as multiple-choice options which are contradicted). Especially if you also discuss why each answer is what it is (and isn’t other options), it is easy to spot when they couldn’t catch what was said or missed important pronunciation clues like ones showing a change of topic. You can then elicit the actual words that were said onto the board before following the steps above.

 

IELTS Listening “errors”
If you write down some gapfill answer in the way they are pronounced rather than the way they are spelt, this can be a good way of showing the pronunciation as well as teaching students spellings that they will need to know in the test (as all spelling must be correct in IELTS Listening). This works well for:

silent letters (correcting “exibition hall” X, etc)
homophones (correcting “the root home” X, etc)
changes when words are put together such as intrusive sounds (correcting “coffee yexports” X, etc)
schwa (correcting “thirteen dollers” X, etc)
double letters (correcting “anual event” X, etc)
After changing to the right spelling, students could test each other on the spelling and pronunciation by:

saying the word in the way that it is spelt or saying it in the way that it is pronounced, and seeing if their partner can spot which version they said
saying a word as it is pronounced and seeing if their partner can write it down
saying a word as it is pronounced and seeing if their partner can spell it back
saying a word as it is spelt and seeing if their partner can say it back more naturally
spelling a word and seeing if their partner can say it as it is pronounced
 

IELTS Listening simplest responses
For more focussed practice of what they tend to find tricky in gapfill answers and other words they need to comprehend, this is my favourite first activity. Make a list of some tricky words to pronounce and therefore to understand, along with accompanying contrasting words. For example, you should be able to find around 20 real gapfill answers that have tricky minimal pairs for your students such as “seat” and “sheet”. Give the students a worksheet with the words in A and B columns, and “A” and “B” cards to hold up as they hear them. Students listen to individual words and/ or words in example sentences and race to hold up the right card, e.g. holding up “A” if they hear the A column word “dorm” but “B” if they hear the B word “dome”. They can then play the same game in groups and test each other in other ways such as:

saying a single word for their partner to spell
saying a single word for their partner to put into an example sentence
pointing at a word and getting their partner to pronounce it
pointing at paired words and checking if their partner can pronounce both
saying the A version then the B version or just saying the same version twice, and seeing if their partner can spot what they have done
This also works for homophones (A: heard, B: herd), but obviously only with whole sentences for context.

For other points above like schwa, silent letters and double letters, I put a real exam example into a two-word phrase such as a compound noun in which the other word does not have that feature, as in “deserted island”. Without having a list to look at, students try to work out which of the two parts have that feature and race to hold up cards saying “1st word” or “2nd word”, depending on which part they think has schwa, a silent letter or doubled letters. They can then mark those features on the worksheet before testing each other in the ways listed above.
